Real men don't need other people, and
Real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public
Oh, I think I'm a real man
Little boys cry and look around for comfort
And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say "I can take that!"
Oh, you are my little boy
Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down and tell me
"Well done, girl, you're looking good"
Real men keep cool in the face of a fire
Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat
'Cause they're above that, damn it
Oh, I'm gonna be a real man
Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down
And give me your love for being so good
But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely
For a little while
So little boy, say you want me
'Cause, well, I can't take it
Go ahead
Do it, do it
