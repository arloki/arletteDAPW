Mmm, mhm, mhm
Mmm, mhm, mhm
Treasure hunter you are dead, the light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end, your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your working mind, don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide with the monsters on your shoulder
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Oh hunter, if you didn't want the beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it in your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human, don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you, though the struggle will be daily
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Pearl diver
Dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver
Dive, dive down
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, uh
Treasure hunter you are dead, the light of the world is fading
